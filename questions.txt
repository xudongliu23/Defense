Dr. Hayes:
	1. Have you considered infinite domains?
	2. Would the problems be easier should the attributes be binary?
	3. Statistical significance?

Dr. Jaromczyk:
	1. What is the complexity of collapsing trees?

Dr. Cheung:
	1. The problem of learning the smallest model satisfying as many examples as possible?
	2. Compactness of the PLP-trees?
	3. Compare learning results with other lanuages (e.g., ASO, CP-nets)?

Promising future directions:
	1. Approximating CP-nets using trees.
	2. Learning trees on more datasets.
	3. Preference applications.
